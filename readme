How to change options:
  In file pyNekketsu.py, change the line "match=Match(1,3,0,3,5)".
  The Match parameters are: (nbr_players_teamA,nbr_persos_teamA,nbr_players_teamB,nbr_persos_teamB,difficulty),
  where "player" refers only to human players, and "perso" to human or computer players.
  Maximum human players is 2, difficulty is an interger from 0 to 10.
  Goalkeepers are not counted in nbr_persos_team.
  For more information, see examples below.

  Examples:

   * to play versus computer in 3 vs 3 teams (medium AI): match=Match(1,4,0,4,5)
   * to play human vs human (only): match=Match(1,1,1,1,0)
   * to play human vs human in 2 vs 5 teams (low AI): match=Match(1,2,1,5,3)
