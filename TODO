Bug:
 - if B during team select => make a special goto in menu.xml ?
 - goal is not precise
 - make GK able to take the ball far if there is no one else
 - make the GK go closer to the goal then somebody attacks

 - make players able to avoid collision ? (depending on strength)
 - be able to change attacking and collision distances
 - when a cpu player has the ball, and the second closest to the ball is an enemy and it the direction of the goal, and there are more than 1 player per teams, pass.

 - correct ref_pos scale with overlaping
 - improve GK jump time (depending on ball speed?)
 - change difficulty : shrink team charateristics
 - use health and endurance, and make stronger players avoid attacks
 - change ball hurting : only if ball is out of collision rectangle
 - what to do if choose twice the same team ?
 - make xml for fields, and choice in menu
 - use surface.fill for sky and grass (because it's optimized?)

 
Retrogamelib bugs :
 - menu size
 - dialog progress too soon
 - added center_shift to help centering text

Doc :
 - possible to take the ball when someone is goint to shoot
 - you can ask your teamate to pass the ball to the closest player of your team
 - you can ask your teamate to shoot, in the direction you give


 - fight mode : no goal, earn points when hurt foe with the ball
